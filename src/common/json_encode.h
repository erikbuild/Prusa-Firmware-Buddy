/**
 * \file
 *
 * \brief Encoding JSON.
 *
 * The networking needs to handle JSON data, in both directions.
 *
 * For decoding, we have jsmn (not sure if it's a good option ‒ it needs the
 * whole input at once, can't parse in streaming fashion. Furthermore, it
 * doesn't de-escape strings).
 *
 * This file provides very minimal set of utils for encoding JSON. Most things
 * can be just encoded with printf or similar (numbers, names of fields, the
 * general structure) ‒ while that's not exactly convenient and a bit of error
 * prone (nothing checks for syntax errors), it's doable.
 *
 * But we need booleans and we need strings (as these might need some escaping).
 *
 * Note that this also supports somewhat minimal way to do chunked JSON
 * rendering ‒ with printf-rendering, one can just try adding more things until
 * it no longer fits and leave the rest for later.

/**
 * \brief Macro to put the jsonification of strings together conveniently.
 *
 * Usually, one wants to first check how large a buffer for the rendered JSON
 * shall be, then create the buffer on stack and render into that. This is not
 * possible to wrap into a function (because the buffer needs to be on the
 * caller's stack), therefore it is a macro.
 *
 * Note that the macro is not "hygienic" and it expands into multiple
 * statements (wrapping it into do {} while (0) would also destroy the buffer)
 * and creating several local variables. Be conservative in its use.
 *
 * * Have a `const char * or std::string_view` input variable with a certain name.
 * * Call the macro with that variable name.
 * * A variable `std::string_view name_escaped` is created. Eg:
 *
 * ```
 * const char *whatever = "hello\nworld";
 * JSONIFY_STR(whatever);
 * printf("%.*s", (int)whatever_escaped.size(), whatever_escaped.data());
 * ```
